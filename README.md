# Combined Enumerator
This is my orginial attempt at [Hackergrounds - combined enumerator](https://github.com/hackerground/combined_ordered_enumerator/blob/master/combined_enumerator_test.rb). Does this actually achieve the expected outcome even though all of the test pass? Or is this a prime example of making sure that your tests, cover EVERY eventuality not just the most common.
